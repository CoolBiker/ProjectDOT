# ProjectDOT-by-Limewire
A dox organization tool, written by Limewire in Python.
 
Before you use this, I would like to thank my close friend and partner in crime Pascal for helping me through this.
And a disclaimer: I am not responsible for what you do with this tool. 
This project is open-source and thus anyone can contribute to it and make it better.
I started this project due to Drizzy's Dox Tool being ratted, I don't want to deal with that shit.
You can't search usernames on here but you can automatically save your results to a .txt file.
Here is a resource to find usernames: instantusername.com

and finally; have fun.
